# Audit fixes — 2026-10-02

Goal: implement and verify the eighteen ordered audit work packages, without merge or deployment.
Branch: `fix/audit-2026-10-02`.
Application baseline: `bda761d81deb0be37af9fad31f5469efb992df82`.
Audit baseline: `e666096b55d1a2a887374feb7c7cd743e8cbe111`.
Last secured remote commit: `a84fc0f4f5a7fa8d263c4e1ff0419bb5a591b25c` (initial checkpoint). Local checkpoint: `dcf5cd4`. CLI push is unavailable; GitHub API mirrors verified local trees without force updates.

## Actual repository state

- Real Git clone is available. Initial `--no-checkout` staging deletions were the unmaterialized clone, not existing user work. Switching the new branch materialized all files; `git status --short` was empty.
- Remote main and the audit branch match the supplied baselines; no newer application delta.
- Only open PR found: #108, stale enchant branch. No audit fix branch existed.
- Current user authorization overrides AGENTS.md's historical automatic merge instruction: no merge/deployment.
- Read repository AGENTS.md, product/profile/math specifications, render safety, task queue and continuation records. Audit handover documents copied byte-for-byte from the pinned audit branch.

## Changes, evidence and validation

- Confirmed main-state writes in sixteen modules bypass the core app guard, including startup derived-stat/capability adapters.
- Confirmed backup validator selects envelope version with `||` and overwrites the inner version before migration.
- Tests: not yet run in this checkout. Historical audit passes are not fix acceptance.
- Running CI/processes: none. Clone session 32815 completed with exit 0.
- Current interruption/error: none; implementation has started, this checkpoint is incomplete.
- Next executable step: route all main-state writes through one guard, add future-schema raw-byte and backup disagreement regressions, then run targeted tests.

## Packages 1–2 checkpoint

- Added `src/app-storage.js`: single guarded main-state write/reset owner, read-only access, recheck disk at every write (cross-tab upgrade protection). Routed all 15 existing runtime writers through it; profile imports/sync and restore use strict rejection. Future-schema actions are blocked before editor listeners; navigation/export/reload remain available. Raw backup export reads saved data, not the older UI projection.
- Fixed startup derived-cache dispatch to announce only a successful write, avoiding a repeated rejected-write loop.
- Backup validation checks both independent schema declarations before migration, rejects disagreement and invalid explicit versions, retains legacy omitted-version migration.
- New regressions: future raw bytes and opaque fields, cross-tab upgrade, supported migrations/reset, no bypass writer, future envelope/inner disagreement, invalid version types.
- Targeted persistence/import suite: 66/66 pass, exit 0. Expanded backup/property/UI route suite after corrections: 29/29 pass, exit 0.
- Initial full Node suite: 1,365/1,367 passed, exit 1. Both failures addressed: legacy omitted backupVersion compatibility and old source assertion requiring the unsafe direct restore writer. Not yet claiming a repeated full-suite pass.
- Browser runtime unavailable locally (no Chrome/Playwright found yet); CI browser verification will run on a remote fix commit.
- Next: packages 3–6 (reforge exclusivity, physical pet UUID, missing numeric inputs, contest adapter).
